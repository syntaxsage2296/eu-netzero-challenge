## 🧐 In-Depth Analysis
### Why Are Some Renovation Measures More Cost-Effective?
Renovations like insulation and efficient window glazing have a high impact on energy savings for a relatively low investment. These upgrades reduce heat loss, leading to lower heating and cooling costs.

**Key Insight:** Prioritizing these measures can significantly lower energy bills while maintaining affordability.

### How Do Energy Cost Savings Translate into Financial Efficiency?
Renovations such as heat pumps and RT2012-compliant insulation provide long-term energy cost savings. While initial investment costs may be higher, these upgrades pay for themselves through reduced energy bills.

**Key Insight:** Financially efficient renovations are ideal for homeowners and businesses looking for long-term savings and return on investment.

### Which Building Elements Affect Energy Consumption the Most?
Buildings with large, uninsulated roofs and poorly designed windows lose the most energy. Insulating walls, roofs, and floors and upgrading to energy-efficient glazing can dramatically reduce consumption.

**Key Insight:** Targeting high-impact elements like insulation and window upgrades should be a priority for improving energy efficiency.

## 🏁 Conclusion
🔑 Key Takeaways
- Prioritize cost-effective renovations – Methods like 3CL-DPE and RT2012 deliver high energy savings at a low cost.
- Invest in financially efficient upgrades – Renovations with the highest cost savings per euro spent should be encouraged.
- Focus on high-impact building elements – Insulation, window efficiency, and reducing heat loss through roofs and floors are essential.

## 📌 Recommendations
### For Homeowners:
Start with insulation (roof, walls, and floors) to reduce heating costs.
Consider energy-efficient window glazing to minimize heat loss.
Upgrade to modern heating systems to reduce overall consumption.

### For Policymakers:
Subsidize high-impact renovations such as insulation and energy-efficient glazing.
Promote financial incentives for energy-efficient renovation programs.
Encourage compliance with RT2012 and future energy standards.

### For Builders & Investors:
Construct energy-efficient buildings with proper insulation and passive design.
Retrofitting older buildings should focus on the highest-impact elements like roofs, windows, and insulation.
